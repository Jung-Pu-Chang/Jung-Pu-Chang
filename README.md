## ðŸ“ƒ: Experience
- **2022.9 - Data Analyst at [Datarget](https://www.datarget.com/)**<br>

- **2020.9 ~ 2022.1 - Research Assistant in [NLP Lab](https://nlp.bigdata.scu.edu.tw/)(@DS.SCU)** <br>
   - Invented a combination model of neural network and statistic method for co-reference resolution. Improved F1-score from 78.3 to 79.2.
   - Built and trained a multi-topic GPT2 model, and improved the model performance by model tuning and spelling corrections handling.
   - Developed a hierarchical attention network (HAN) model to learn the three different aspect of hope, trigger event and arousal from society community post. Improved the F1-score from 0.58 to 0.86 on the prediction of depression.
   - Invented a dynamic MRT station embedding model for passenger flow prediction. Replaced the traditional station embedding model Node2Vec and improved MAE from 1.47 to 0.93, 36% increased.
        
- **2019.9 ~ 2020.6 - Data Analysis Intern at [Deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com/global/en.html)** <br>
  - Completed the deployment of machine learning model on the Django platform for economic indicator trend prediction.
  - Researched the practical application of OCR in financial statements and achieved a digital recognition rate of 86%.
  - Maintained news and social web crawlers, and developed robotic process automation (RPA) programs to handle unstructured data.

- **2019.7 ~ 2019.8 - Automatic Speech Recognition Intern at [Delta Electronics](https://www.deltaww.com/en-US/index)** <br>
  - Annotated noise span in recordings and modified the speech recognition models to detection noise.
  - Developed a noise detection deep learning model and deployed on the internal system with Flask. The model is stacked the CNN model with soft-attention mechanism and LSTM as prediction model. Achieved 89% accuracy rate in noise span.

- **2018.3 ~ 2019.6 - Research Assistant in Information Fusion Lab** <br>
  - Developed a micro-expression recognition model to identify readersâ€™ investment styles, and combined recommendation systems to recommend suitable financial articles for readers. Achieved 91% F1-score.
  - Deployed the financial recognition APP on Zenbo robot, combined with personalized dashboard to present financial information exclusive to users. This APP earned Honorable Mention in HNCB Fintechers competitions.

- **2016.9 ~ 2020.7 - Bachelor student in SCU (@DS.SCU)** <br>
